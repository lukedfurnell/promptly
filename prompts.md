Act as a world-class React and JavaScript engineer. Refactor the provided app.js file to improve readability, modularity, and maintainability, while also removing all SEO wrapper and Helmet-related code. Specifically:

1. Eliminate SEOWrapper components and all <Helmet> tags, and refactor the routing and component structure accordingly.
2. Remove any now-unneeded props or logic related to SEO handling and canonical URLs.
3. Organize and group imports logically, and remove any that are no longer required.
4. Split large or complex components into smaller, reusable components if feasible.
5. Follow React best practices in hook usage and component naming.
6. Add succinct comments for any significant code changes or restructuring.

Return only the updated code. At the top of the file, summarize key structural changes in comments.
