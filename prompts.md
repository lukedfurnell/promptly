<ImprovedPrompt>
Adopt the role of a highly skilled React engineer. Refactor the provided `app.js` file using these guidelines:

- Remove all SEO wrappers (`SEOWrapper` and related Helmet logic) from the route elements. Ensure the routing works correctly without these wrappers.
- Improve clarity, readability, and maintainability throughout the code.
- Remove any unused or redundant imports and code.
- Group and order imports logically.
- Extract large or complex logic into smaller, reusable components if suitable.
- Comment on any non-obvious code sections where helpful.
- Follow modern React best practices, especially regarding hooks and component structure.

Return only the refactored code. At the top as a comment, briefly summarize the major changes you have made.

<ImprovedPrompt>
Adopt the role of a highly skilled React developer. Rewrite the provided App.js file with the following requirements:

- Remove all uses of the SEOWrapper component from the routes. Replace them with direct rendering of the route components (e.g., <CategoryDetail />, <ClubProfile />).
- Retain all other functionality, including routing logic, Google Analytics setup, and application structure.
- Do not include any SEO/Helmet wrapper logic in your rewritten code.
- Improve code clarity and organization as appropriate, grouping imports logically and ensuring components are clearly defined.
- Do not add or remove any features outside of removing SEOWrapper usage.
- Return only the complete, revised App.js code.
- Briefly summarize any consequential structural changes as comments at the very top of the file.

<ImprovedPrompt>
Adopt the role of an expert React engineer. Refactor the provided `app.js` React application file to enhance its clarity, organization, and maintainability, with a key requirement:

- **Remove the SEOWrapper from specified routes.**
  - Keep the SEOWrapper for routes where SEO metadata is critical (such as category views, club profiles, and blog pages), but omit it for routes where enhanced SEO handling is unnecessary, including the homepage, about, releases, help, claim club, and region detail pages.

Apply the following general improvements across the codebase:
1. **Clean and Organize**
   - Remove unused or redundant imports and code.
   - Group and order imports for readability.

2. **Component and Logic Structure**
   - Break down large components into smaller reusable ones as appropriate.
   - Move handler and utility functions outside of render returns.
   - Follow React best practices for hooks and component patterns.

3. **Maintain Functionality**
   - Preserve all routing, analytics, and existing features.
   - Maintain backward compatibility with legacy routes.

4. **Formatting and Comments**
   - Use clean, consistent formatting.
   - Add brief comments summarizing major refactor or redesign changes at the top of the file.

Return only the revised `app.js` file code, beginning with a concise summary (in comments) highlighting the key changes, particularly the removal of SEOWrapper from the designated routes.

<ImprovedPrompt>
Adopt the role of a senior React engineer and refactor the provided `app.js` file for a modern web application. Your goals are to enhance code quality, maintainability, and clarity. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Code Structure**
   - Organize and group imports logically.
   - Remove any redundant, unused, or outdated imports or code.
   - Add brief explanatory comments to complex or non-obvious code sections.
   - Ensure consistent use of component naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase).

2. **Component Organization**
   - Evaluate if large components (such as `App` or `HomePage`) can be decomposed into smaller, reusable components. Refactor accordingly if beneficial.
   - Move inline callbacks or handler functions out of JSX return blocks where appropriate, for better readability.

3. **React and Routing Best Practices**
   - Use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` following React best practices.
   - Ensure routing logic is clear and canonical URLs for SEO are properly handled.
   - Update any deprecated React Router or React GA usage to current conventions.

4. **SEO and Analytics**
   - Ensure that all SEO-relevant logic (via Helmet or SEOWrapper) is consistently and clearly structured.
   - Maintain proper initialization and event tracking for Google Analytics.

5. **Formatting and Style**
   - Maintain consistent indentation and whitespace.
   - Use self-documenting code where possible, but add concise comments as needed for maintainability.

**Instructions:**  
Return only the fully rewritten version of the file. At the top of the file, include a brief comment summarizing any major improvements or changes you made.
