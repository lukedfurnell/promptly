<ImprovedPrompt>
Refactor the provided React application file for improved clarity, maintainability, and best practices. Preserve all existing functionality and features, including handling of routes, SEO metadata with Helmet, Google Analytics integration, and all imports/components. 

Please address the following during refactoring:

- Organize imports logically (library imports, component imports, asset imports, styles).
- Separate concerns by grouping logically related functionality (e.g., SEO helpers, Analytics setup).
- Clarify component structure, using clear naming and comments where helpful.
- Ensure consistent code formatting and adherence to JavaScript/React conventions.
- Minimize repetition (e.g., repeated SEOWrapper logic).
- If suitable, extract repeated code sections into reusable helper functions or components.
- Do not alter any major user-facing behavior or routing logic.

Apply these improvements to the complete file as provided within the context.

<ImprovedPrompt>
Given the following React code, improve its styling to increase readability and maintainability. Do NOT change or refactor the functional or logical structure of the code. Focus only on aspects such as:

- Consistent indentation and spacing
- Line breaks for clarity (e.g., separate props on multiple lines)
- Grouping related imports with clear separation
- Clear separation between component definitions
- Consistent bracket placement
- Readable formatting for JSX

Return the entire file with improved styling, making no changes to variable names or logic. Use best practices for code formatting in modern React projects.

<ImprovedPrompt>
Rewrite the provided React application file to improve code clarity, maintainability, and modern best practices. Ensure to:

- Refactor for consistency in component structure and import order.
- Remove deprecated or unnecessary code.
- Optimize the use of React hooks (such as `useState` and `useEffect`) for readability and minimalism.
- Maintain all routing logic, SEO handling, and component functionalities as in the original.
- Enhance readability by using clear comments, better variable naming, and consistent formatting.

Use the original file content below as the basis for your rewrite.

- Reorganize imports for readability.
- Ensure consistent formatting and indentation.
- Refactor components where logical for better separation of concerns.
- Replace any deprecated or suboptimal patterns with current React standards (e.g., use functional components, hooks).
- Double-check SEO logic and canonical URL handling for correctness and reusability.
- Retain all existing functionality (routing, analytics, club search, SEO, etc.), but clarify and clean up code as much as possible.
- Briefly comment on major changes if significant refactoring is involved.

<ImprovedPrompt>
Refactor the provided React application file to improve its code structure, readability, and maintainability. Follow these guidelines:

1. **General Code Quality**
   - Remove redundancies and unused code or imports.
   - Group related imports together logically.
   - Ensure component names follow conventions (e.g., PascalCase).
   - Add concise comments to clarify non-obvious sections.

2. **Component Structure & Organization**
   - Split large or complex components into smaller, reusable components if appropriate.
   - Move inline functions or handlers out of the render method where applicable.
   - Ensure that logic and UI concerns are separated cleanly.

3. **Best Practices**
   - Use explicit and descriptive prop names.
   - Replace any deprecated React patterns with modern alternatives.
   - Ensure hooks (such as useEffect and useState) are used correctly.
   - Optimize for readability and maintainability.

4. **SEO and Routing**
   - Ensure SEO-related features (Helmet/SEOWrapper) are consistently used.
   - Verify that route structures are clear and canonical URLs are correctly constructed.

**Context:**  
You are working with a React application file that sets up routing, SEO handling, Google Analytics, and renders various pages for a running club discovery site.

Return only the revised, refactored code. Briefly annotate any major structural or design changes at the top of the file in comments.
